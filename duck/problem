There are four types of ducks in the game: Mallard Duck, Redhead Duck, Rubber Duck, and Decoy Duck.
All types of the ducks have the same swim behavior but are with different displays.
Some ducks can fly with wings, but some cannot fly.
A duck can quack, squeak, or be silent.
A duck can change its fly or quack behavior at run time.
New fly or quack behaviors can be added, and the existing behaviors can be modified at compile time.
